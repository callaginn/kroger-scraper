# Kroger Receipt Sweeper
Downloads itemized receipts from a Kroger account with Puppeteer and categorizes them using the Kroger API and custom data cleanup scripts.

```
brew install 1password-cli
yarn install
```

## How to Use

### 1. Scrape Kroger Data (Two Methods)
> _At the moment, both methods have to be manually copied/pasted into a json file, such as `src/data/receipts.json`._

#### a. Scrape with `yarn sweep`
This experimental script logs into Kroger and scrapes all the receipt data automatically.

#### b. Scrape with console scripts
If you run into issues with the automated scripts above, you can revert to a more manual process to collect the same data. This process includes logging in, navigating to the "/mypurchases" page, opening up the Chrome Console, and pasting in code from the "scrape*.md" files.

Since this process involves you controlling a regular version of Chrome, it's the least likely to be flagged as a bot. And unlike the automated scripts, it allows you to intervene if it runs into issues. We'll use **scrape2b.md** as an example.

This script is able to get a list of all the purchases, but often fails after collecting a few itemized receipts. I believe this is because bot protection is being triggered, but haven't found an automated way to bypass that.

If it fails when fetching a batch of receipts, you can do the following:
- Scroll/click around the Kroger interface a bit so that they reflag you as a human. Make sure you stay on the "/mypurchases" page though. There's some tabs at top that stay on the same page.
- In the console, manually rerun the batch that failed and the ones afterwards. For example, if it fails while grabbing the fourth batch, you'll need to run `processBatch(batches, 3)` and subsequent batches.
- Repeat the steps above if additional batches fail.

### 2. Cleanup with `yarn cleanup`

This script grabs a simplified array of products from `receipts.json` and exports them to `products.json`.

### 3. Get product categories with `yarn lookup`
This script loads `products.json` and uses the Kroger api to request information about all the products. These categorized products are saved to `src/data/categories.json`.

### 4. Categorize items with `yarn categorize`
This script matches the products from `products.json` to `receipts.json`. Easiest course of action would be looping through categories.json and assigning the category based off the upc key.

## Development Info and Scripts
The `src/dev/docs` folder contains a list of markdown files that explains how the process works.

Run `yarn dev bot` to get a feel for how bot detectors like [Akamai's Bot Manager](https://www.akamai.com/products/bot-manager) (used by Kroger) detect bots and ID your device by browser.
